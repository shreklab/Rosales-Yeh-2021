Code and Data for Yeh, Rosales et al. (2021) on hypoxia sensing in larval zebrafish

Data is in *SourceData*, with three tables in *t x n* format, with *t* timepoints and *n* neurons. One table is for neurons in the second ganglion, another for the third ganglion, and a third lists all neurons in either ganglion (i.e., traces.xlsx).

Code to run analyses and reproduce some figures is in *Code*
